NameError: The name 'sample_names' is unknown in this context. Please make sure that you defined that variable. Also note that braces not used for variable access have to be escaped by repeating them, i.e. {{print $1}}, when formatting the following:

			sample_names=($(cat /share/quonlab/workspaces/tmathieu/meyersData/reference.table | awk '{{ print $4 }}' | sort | uniq))
			for name in ${sample_names[@]}
			do
				bash {params.endGraph} -N name -R {params.refTable} -G {params.genomeFasta} -A {params.genomeAnnotation} 
			done
